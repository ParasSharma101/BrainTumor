The project utilizes the [Figshare Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427) . The dataset consists of 3064  MRI images, resized to 256 x 256 pixels, representing different stages of Brain Tumor disease.

### Dataset Details

- Total Images: 3064
- Classes:
  - Class 1: Glioma (1426 images)
  - Class 2: Meningioma (708 images)
  - Class 3: Pituitary (930 images)



## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework used for building and training deep learning models.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow. It provides an intuitive interface for designing and training models.
- Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis.
- Matplotlib: A popular plotting library used for data visualization, including the visualization of MRI images and performance metrics.
- NumPy: A fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides tools for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and performance metrics.

## Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

In the initial steps of the project, the dataset of Alzheimer's disease brain MRI images undergoes preprocessing and augmentation to enhance the data quality and increase the robustness of the model. The following steps are performed:

- Image extraction: Originally images were organized in matlab data format (.mat file).For classification purpose images were extracted from .mat files via [code](https://github.com/Nirmit1910/BrainTumor/blob/main/img_extraction.m)
- Image Preprocessing: Further images were preprocessed using [code](https://github.com/Nirmit1910/BrainTumor/blob/main/preprocessing.py) where noises were removed and images were resized to 256x256 from 512x512 pixels.
- Data Augmentation: The training data is augmented using techniques such as rescaling, shearing, and zooming to increase its diversity and improve the model's ability to generalize.
- Data Normalization: The validation and test data are rescaled for normalization.
- ImageDataGenerators: The Keras `ImageDataGenerator` is used to generate batches of augmented images for the training set and normalized images for the validation and test sets.
- Class Mode: The class mode is set to 'categorical' to support multi-class classification.

These steps ensure that the dataset is properly prepared for training and evaluating deep learning models for the classification of Brain Tumor's using brain MRI images.
